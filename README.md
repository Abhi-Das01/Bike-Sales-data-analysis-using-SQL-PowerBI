# Bike-Sales-data-analysis-using-SQL-PowerBI
In this project I analyzed a datasets which contained the sales report of bicycles. For this analysis I used SQL to clean the dataseta and PowerBI to visually represent the data to get the insights from the dataset more easily.
Firstly, I imported the all three datasets into SQL to manipulate and clean the data. I used select, join, CTE and other functions to retrive the required data for the analysis process.
Once I was able to get the required data from the dataset, I loaded data into PowerBI for representing the dataset graphically (Data Visualization), which revealed important insights such as the profit margin, peak sales timing or days for the week, revenue in each season and revenue with respect to profit.
